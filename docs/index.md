# Welcome to model-index documentation

The model-index library has two goals:

- Make it easy to maintain a source-of-truth index of ML model metadata 
- Enable the community to browse this model metadata on [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/) 

You can use this library locally or choose to upload the metadata to [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com)
to have your library featured on the website.
